[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/about/) is an annual event during the month of October to encourage open-source contributions. If you've ever wanted to contribute to Astro, this is your opportunity. From beginner to experienced, from developer to low/no-code contributor, you're welcome!

:::note
Since Hacktoberfest happens once a year during October, assume the information on this page to be only valid and up-to-date during October of each year.

Things such as participating repos, rules, instructions, rewards, and so on may vary from year to year.

## Join the fest

To take part in Hacktoberfest, here's all you need to do:

1. Register for the event on [Hacktoberfest's official website](https://hacktoberfest.com/).
2. Make any [valid contributions](#contributions) following [Hacktoberfest's rules](https://hacktoberfest.com/participation/#pr-mr-details) during October.
3. Let us know you're participating by requesting your PRs to be labeled as `hacktoberfest-accepted`.

## Primer on open-source

Especially for first-time contributors, open-source can be quite frightening -- but don't worry, we're here to help you succeed! Here are a few reliable resources you can read to get up to speed on the matter:

- [What is open-source](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/what-is-open-source)
- [How to contribute to open-source](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/)
- [How to use Git](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/cheatsheets/how-to-use-git-a-reference-guide)
- [Getting started with GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/overview/getting-started-with-github-desktop)

## Contributions

Any contribution to [participating repositories](#participating-repositories) will be considered and count towards Hacktoberfest. Our only exceptions are contributions that are either spam attempts or that have no quality and effort.

:::caution
AI contributions will not be accepted. Hacktoberfest exists to incentivize human contribution to open-source projects, and therefore, we cannot accept contributions that have been made by automated tools.

This does not apply to AI assistance tools, such as GitHub Copilot or Cursor, that do not take over the core work of contributing from you.

## Participating repositories

### Astro Docs

The [`withastro/docs` repository](https://github.com/withastro/docs) contains the complete source code and content for the [Astro documentation](https://docs.astro.build/) website in all the available languages.

Here are some of the main ways you can contribute to it:

- Reading the current or [5.0 beta docs](https://5-0-0-beta.docs.astro.build/) and fixing any typos, grammar issues, or missing information.
- Helping [translate the documentation](http://contribute.docs.astro.build/guides/i18n/) in your language.
- Tackling [open "good first issues"](https://github.com/withastro/docs/issues?q=sort%3Aupdated-desc+is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) in the repository.

:::note[TODO]
Adding information on the other participating repositories, I need to confirm.

## Rewards

All participating contributors will get thematic [Hacktoberfest Astro Badges](https://astro.badg.es/achievements/hacktoberfest-merges/bronze/) that "level up" as you contribute. You can showcase your Astro badges in a daily updated profile card, like this one:
